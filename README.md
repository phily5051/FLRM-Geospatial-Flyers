# FLRM-Geospatial-Flyers
The geospatial flyers were developed during my internship within the Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism (FLRM) team at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Using QGIS and Photoshop software, I aimed to raise awareness of the FLR activities in each beneficiary country. Leveraging my skills in geospatial analysis and data visualisation, I successfully summarised key FLR activities and presented them visually in an accessible format. The development process involved close collaboration with FLR country project coordinators to ensure accuracy and relevance.
