# FLRM-Geospatial-Flyers
The geospatial flyers were developed during my internship within the *[Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism](https://www.fao.org/in-action/forest-landscape-restoration-mechanism/en/)* team at the *Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)*. 

Using **QGIS** and **Photoshop software**, I aimed to <ins>raise awareness of the FLR activities in each beneficiary country</ins>. Leveraging my skills in geospatial analysis and data visualisation, I successfully summarised key FLR activities and presented them visually in an accessible format. The development process involved close collaboration with FLR country project coordinators to ensure accuracy and relevance.
